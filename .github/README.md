## What is Sudoku?
 
 + Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to fill in the numbers in a 9x9 grid so that each row, each column and each 3x3 grid section contains all the numbers from 1 to 9. 
 + Like a logic puzzle, Sudoku also is a great brain game. If you play Sudoku every day, you will soon start to see improvements in your concentration and overall brain power.
